<h4>What is the background for this editor?</h4>

This is an editor for an exchange format for programming exercises which is
supported by a variety of tools from different universities. The format is documented at this
<a href="https://github.com/ProFormA/taskxml" target="new">GitHub site</a>. Because 
different tools implement the format in different manners, not everything
that is supported by this editor actually works in every tool.

<h4>What do the messages in red underneath the submit buttons mean?/
Why is no output produced?</h4>

These are error messages. They are generated when form elements are missing
or when an XML file is read that contains missing information or incorrect tags. 
A task should only be uploaded to LON-CAPA if there are no error messages.
Apart from missing information, another source of errors are duplicate IDs:
each file, test and model solution must have a unique ID. Model solutions and most tests
must reference a file.

<h4>How do I reload/start a new task?</h4>

In some browsers it is sufficient to reload the page of the editor. In Firefox one needs to use
<b>shift reload</b> to empty the form content.

<h4>How do I give a code template to the students?</h4>

See the explanation for file/class below.

<h4>How do I specify a path for a file?</h4>

The filename can contain a path (in Unix notation using backslashes). <br />
If a file is needed as a library in a subdirecty, it is important that this
file is of class 'library' or 'internal-library'. In that case the subdirectory
will be created as needed by the system.

<h4>How do I check static details about the code? How do I prohibit students from using 
(or require them to use) a construct?</h4>

Checkstyle can be used. It is quite powerful. It supports regular expressions.

<h4>I have a question about model solutions:</h4>

At least one model solution must be provided. It should be uploaded as a file
which is referenced using Fileref1 from a model solution element. The file
should probably be of class 'internal' so that the students cannot see it.
The reason for requiring a model solution is because it makes it easier to
reuse a task at a later point. Some tools (but not LON-CAPA) use the model solution 
for comparison with the students' submissions. (If it is really not feasible 
to upload a model solution in exceptional circumstances
then an empty file could be provided instead.) If the students create their submission via a
textarea, then the filename of the model solution is used as the filename of the
student-submitted code.

<h4>Can the students upload a file instead of using copy/paste in LON-CAPA?</h4>

Not at the moment. We are working on that, though.
<!-- The mimetype for the submission should be: ^(application/.*jar)$ -->

<h4>Why has a task been passed/failed even though not all/all tests have been passed?</h4>

If tests are set to non-public, the result is not shown to students. If a non-public test has
been failed, the whole task might be failed even though the students cannot see why. On the
other hand, if a test is set to be "not required", a task can be passed without passing
this test.

<h4>Does the order of the tests matter? Why does my JUnit test not work?</h4>

The order of the tests does matter. The compile test should be selected before any JUnit tests.

<h4>There appears to be a crash when I try to test a task.</h4>

Please check whether all required fields of the editor have been filled in. If there
is an error message showing underneath the 'Export XML file'-button, the error needs
to be fixed. A 'Schemas validity error' usually means that some required fields
have not been filled in. If it still crashes even though everything seems fine, please 
contact us at the address at the bottom of this page. Please send us a copy of the
task zip file that causes the problem.

<h4>What about versions?</h4>

The select menus show which software versions are supported by the backend software.<br />
The exchange format itself is versioned as well. The editor reads xml files in different versions (version 0.9.4 and 1.0.1).
The version of the editor's output format can be set via the internal xsdSchemaFile variable.

<h4>What does the following form element mean?</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Description</b>: what the students will see.
<li><b>Submission/max filesize</b>: of the file that is uploaded by the students in kilobytes.
<li><b>Submission/mimetype</b>: what types of files can be uploaded. For Java the exact filename
could be used.
<li><b>LON-CAPA/path to zip file</b>: should be "/res/fhwf/..." and not "/priv/..." because that is where 
it will be after publication. The filename of the zip file is not part of the path. When uploading the
zip file to LON-CAPA its default name is the task title minus any non-alphanumeric characters.
<li><b>Filerefs</b>: Fileref1 in a test must match the ID of a file. This is automatically adjusted
when a filename is selected in a test or model solution. Fileref2 does nothing at this point.
<li><b>File/class</b>: An <b>internal</b> file is not visible to the students. <br />
A <b>template</b> file
should be a piece of code which the students can use as a starting point for their program. It is shown
to the students within the input textarea in LON-CAPA. 
If more than one file is specified as "template", then only the last one is used and
the others are ignored. <br />
A <b>library</b> file can have the same functionality as an internal file (i.e.
can contain tests which are used by the system) but it is also shown to the students. 
A library filename can contain a path.<br />
An <b>internal-library</b> file is not shown to the students.
An internal-library filename can contain a path.<br />
An <b>instruction</b> file is shown to the students but not executed in any manner. It could,
for example, contain a more detailed description of the task.
<li>For tests: <b>public</b>: The students will see the test result.
<li>For tests: <b>required</b>: This test must be passed in order to pass the whole task. 
</ul>

<h4>What has not yet been implemented/does not work?</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Export zip</b>: only works in some browsers (such as Firefox). In other browsers the
xml file needs to be downloaded and then zipped manually.
<li><b>Reading files with the same filename</b> one after the other: this does not work
in some browsers. Some browsers will not reload if the file has the same name as the one
before. Refreshing the browser solves this problem.
<li>There must be <b>at least one file, one model solution and one test</b>. (Without a test there is
no reason to use this editor. The existence of a model solution is required by the exchange
format which is implemented by this editor.)
<li><b>Invisible file content after import</b>: if file content is not visible after import,
clicking in the file content field will make it visible.
<li><b>Filenames are missing</b> in tests after import. This is not a problem because they are
not actually needed. Only the Filerefs are used.
<li>I cannot <b>change a fileref</b>. Select the filename from the drop-down menu. That will
change the fileref.
<li><b>Special characters (such as German umlauts)</b> may not work properly in all fields.
It may depend on the encoding of the characters that is used.
For example, they might not work in JUnit tests.
<li>Not all fields are always used by the grading tool. For example, currently the title of a 
compile test is not displayed in LON-CAPA.
<li>This version of the editor is not yet complete with respect to all tools and the exchange format. 
It focuses on LON-CAPA. 
</ul>

<h4>Details about creating a task in LON-CAPA</h4>

<ul>
<li>The zip file <b>cannot be directly edited in LON-CAPA</b>! Trying to do so might 
lead to a crash. It is possible to edit the files directly via Webdav but only with some 
Webdav-clients. (The LON-CAPA support team can provide more information on how to
access LON-CAPA via Webdav).  
<li>After changing a zip file, it needs to be <b>uploaded</b> again to LON-CAPA. There is an
upload button at the top of the relevant LON-CAPA page which needs to be used because
there is no "edit file" option in the dropdown for the file in LON-CAPA.
<li>The zip file must be <b>published</b> in LON-CAPA each time after it has been changed.
<li><b>Changing the description</b> of a task: LON-CAPA reads the description from the 
problem file, not from the zip. Thus the description can be changed in LON-CAPA
without uploading a new zip file. For archiving purposes it might be useful to change the zip file
as well, though.
<li><b>LON-CAPA problem file</b>: the important information in the problem file is 
in the line starting with "$externalurl = &proforma_url". The first 3 arguments of that
function call should not be changed. The next 3 arguments are:
the filename of the submitted file, the mimetype of the
representation within the LON-CAPA textarea (e.g. for the colouring of reserved words) and
the path to the zip file.
</ul>

<h4>Can I install and configure the editor myself?</h4>

It is possible to turn off LON-CAPA support and Codemirror in the source code of the editor
using the codemirrorOnOrOff and loncapaOnOrOff variables. Different versions of the exchange
format can be set via the xsdSchemaFile variable. There is more information about
<a href="installationFAQ.html" target="new">installation and configuration</a>.
The current version of the editor can be found on 
<a href="https://github.com/ProFormA/formatEditor" target="new">GitHub</a>.
