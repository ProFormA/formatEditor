Running Tests
-------------
For Running the tests the editor must be served by a HTTP server!
This is very important because the tests start the editor with 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/proformaEditor101.html'. 
In order to run a simple HTTP server you can start httpserver.py in the 'tests' working directory (e.g. double click in Windows). 

Testsuite
---------

start testsuite.py in *working* directory 'tests'

If you want to debug a test script set the working directory to the 'tests' directory (not testcases where the actual test scripts are located).
