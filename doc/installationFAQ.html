<h4>Documentation for downloading and configuring the ProFormA Format Editor</h4>

This editor is maintained by members of the ProFormA group within the
<a href="http://www.ecult-niedersachsen.de">eCULT project</a>. The
purpose of the editor is to provide a stand-alone interface for the XML
exchange format for programming exercises (ProFormA) which is
available on <a href="https://github.com/ProFormA/taskxml">GitHub</a>.
A <a href="http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0009-5-41389">research
paper</a> which provides further explanations about this project
has been written by Strickroth et al.

<h4>Installation</h4>

The editor can be downloaded
from <a href="https://github.com/ProFormA/formatEditor">Github</a>. It
is written in Javascript and does not require compilation.

<h4>Documentation</h4>

A user manual (in German) and an FAQ (in English) are available from
within the editor.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

Although the purpose of the ProFormA format is to exchange programming
exercises, not all features are supported by all tools. The editor can therefore be
configured for specific tools.

<ul>
<li>Several variables (such as version094, xsdSchemaFile,
codemirrorOnOrOff and loncapaOnOrOff) can be set within the HTML file
that invokes the editor in order to turn such features on or off.
<li>If new tool-specific features are added to the code, further
variables should be added to turn these features on or off.
<li>Larger tool-specific code should be placed in separate files (such
as loncapa.js).
<li>The main data structure of the editor are arrays of objects which
map the HTML form elements onto the XML elements of the ProFormA
format. In order to add a new HTML and form element, this needs to be
placed in 3 places:
<ul>
<li>Within the <font color="blue">createMapping</font> function, a ValMap
object needs to be created. This should be placed inside the array
that describes how this element occurs in the XML file: whether it occurs once, as a
list, as an attribute, etc.
<li>Within the <font color="blue">createXMLTemplate</font> function, an
XML template for this new element needs to be created.
<li>An HTML form element needs to be created in the HTML file or in
the relevant section "#filesection", "#modelsolutionsection",
"#testsection".
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Known Bugs and Missing Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>Grading hints are not currently used and not tested.
<li>The processing of namespaces could be improved. But jquery (and its
functions such as parseXML) seems to be not namespace-aware and 
there are browser differences for namespaces. Therefore the
current approach is to set/delete/rename namespace prefixes in some places.
<li>XML validation is currently only conducted for the main schema,
not for the other namespaces.
</ul>

Further information is available in the user manual and in the
comments in the code.

Gitlab issue tracking is available
<a href="http://141.41.9.49/ostfalia/formatEditor/issues">here</a>.

<h4>Testing</h4>

A rudimentary Python/Selenium script is
provided: <font color="blue">tests/testsuite.py</font>.  It is not
complete and only works for some settings. It is mostly a suggestion
for future testing development.
